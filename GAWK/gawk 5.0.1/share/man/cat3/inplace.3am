       inplace - emulate sed/perl/ruby in-place editing

       The  _i_n_p_l_a_c_e extension adds two functions named iinnppllaaccee__bbeeggiinn(()) and iinn--
       ppllaaccee__eenndd(()).  These functions are meant to  be  invoked  from  the  _i_n_-
       _p_l_a_c_e_._a_w_k wrapper which is installed when _g_a_w_k is.

       By  default, each named file on the command line is replaced with a new
       file of the same name whose contents are the results of running the AWK
       program.   If the user supplies an AWK variable named IINNPPLLAACCEE__SSUUFFFFIIXX in
       a BBEEGGIINN rule or on the command line, then the  _i_n_p_l_a_c_e  extension  con-
       catenates that suffix onto the original filename and uses the result as
       a filename for renaming the original.

       One can disable inplace editing selectively by placing iinnppllaaccee==00 on the
       command line prior to files that should be processed normally.  One can
       reenable inplace editing by  placing  iinnppllaaccee==11  prior  to  files  that
       should be subject to inplace editing.

       While the extension does attempt to preserve ownership and permissions,
       it makes no attempt to copy the ACLs from the original file.

       If the program dies prematurely, as might happen if an unhandled signal
       is received, a temporary file may be left behind.
