       The  _o_r_d_c_h_r  extension  adds  two functions named oorrdd(()).  and cchhrr(()), as
       follows.

       oorrdd(())  This function takes a string argument, and returns  the  numeric
              value of the first character in the string.

       cchhrr(())  This  function  takes  a  numeric  argument and returns a string
              whose first character is that represented by the number.

       These functions are inspired by the Pascal language  functions  of  the
       same name.
