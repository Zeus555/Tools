       The  _r_w_a_r_r_a_y extension adds two functions named wwrriitteeaa(()).  and rreeaaddaa(()),
       as follows.

       wwrriitteeaa(())
              This function takes a string argument, which is the name of  the
              file to which dump the array, and the array itself as the second
              argument.  wwrriitteeaa(()) understands multidimensional arrays.  It re-
              turns one on success, or zero upon failure.

       rreeaaddaa(())
              is the inverse of wwrriitteeaa(()); it reads the file named as its first
              argument, filling in the array named as the second argument.  It
              clears  the  array  first.  Here too, the return value is one on
              success and zero upon failure.

NNOOTTEESS
       The array created by rreeaaddaa(()) is identical to that written  by  wwrriitteeaa(())
       in  the sense that the contents are the same. However, due to implemen-
       tation issues, the array traversal order of the  recreated  array  will
       likely  be different from that of the original array.  As array traver-
       sal order in AWK is by default undefined, this is not  (technically)  a
       problem.   If  you  need to guarantee a particular traversal order, use
       the array sorting features in _g_a_w_k to do so.

       The file contains binary data.  All integral values are written in net-
       work  byte  order.  However, double precision floating-point values are
       written as native binary data.  Thus,  arrays  containing  only  string
       data can theoretically be dumped on systems with one byte order and re-
       stored on systems with a different one, but this has not been tried.
