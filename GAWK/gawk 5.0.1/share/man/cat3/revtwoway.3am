       The  _r_e_v_t_w_o_w_a_y  extension adds a simple two-way processor that reverses
       the characters in each line sent to it for reading back by the AWK pro-
       gram.   It's  main purpose is to show how to write a two-way extension,
       although it may also be mildly amusing.
