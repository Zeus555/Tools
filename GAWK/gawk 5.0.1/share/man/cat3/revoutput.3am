       The  _r_e_v_o_u_t_p_u_t extension adds a simple output wrapper that reverses the
       characters in each output line.  It's main purpose is to  show  how  to
       write  an output wrapper, although it may be mildly amusing for the un-
       wary.

       BEGIN {
           REVOUT = 1
           print "hello, world" > "/dev/stdout"
       }

       The output from this program is:

       dlrow ,olleh
