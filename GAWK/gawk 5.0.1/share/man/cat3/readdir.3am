       The _r_e_a_d_d_i_r extension adds an input parser for directories.

       When this extension is in use, instead of skipping directories named on
       the command line (or with ggeettlliinnee), they are read, with each entry  re-
       turned as a record.

       The record consists of three fields. The first two are the inode number
       and the filename, separated by a forward slash character.   On  systems
       where  the  directory  entry  contains  the file type, the record has a
       third field which is a single letter indicating the type of the file: ff
       for  file, dd for directory, bb for a block device, cc for a character de-
       vice, pp for a FIFO, ll for a symbolic link, ss for a socket.

       On systems without the file type information, the extension falls  back
       to  calling  _s_t_a_t(2),  in  order  to provide the information.  Thus the
       third field should never be uu.
